# Weather Data Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing weather data from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) API as part of a project for the course "Matematisk Modellering" at Blekinge Technical University. The API allows users to access weather data from a variety of weather stations.

The code in this repository performs statistical analyses on the weather data and presents the results. The specific analyses and visualizations will depend on the specific data and research questions being examined.

To use the code in this repository, you will need to obtain an API key from SMHI and use it to retrieve the desired weather data. The data can then be analyzed using the provided code.

Please note that the code and analysis in this repository is for educational and research purposes only. It should not be used for any official or definitive conclusions about the weather.
